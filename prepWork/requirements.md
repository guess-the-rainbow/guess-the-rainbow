- A user can submit a guess when each box in a row line is filled and will receive feedback on their attempt in the form of symbols

## Data Flow

- array of words
  - can load into local storage to speed up page load

- game board object with these properties:
  - array of randomly generated colors
  - answer from array of words
  - the correct word
  - the correct color combination
  - array of previously guessed words
  - array of attempted color combinations
  - function that compares the current guess with the correct answer
  - render function to display the grid and selectable colors and letters
  - function to assign colors to each selectable letter corresponding to the colors in the answer
  - render keyboard/color-board area
    - update the keyboard colors with each attempt

- array of users (local storage)
  - user statistics object
    - user name
    - total games played
    - win rate
    - win streak counter
    - max number of wins in a row
    - average # of guesses for won games
    - guess distribution
  
0. page loads

1. ask user for their name

2. check local storage:
  - load game dictionary from local storage
    - or store dictionary in local storage
  - check if current player is in the middle of a game
    - if so, load that player's previous game state and render game board from storage
      - parse()
  - if user name not found in local storage, create new user

3. create new user object
 - assign user name to a property
 - load user play stats and assign each to a property
 - create game board object

4. create/load game board object
  - if new user, or no previous game state loaded, create a new game board:
    - generate random number index for the array of possible words
      - use index to get "answer" word from array
      - pass the "answer" word to the game board constructor helper
    - generate randomColors array[] with distinct random colors within specified ranges
      - pass color array[] to the GameBoard() constructor
    - create empty array to store guesses for current game
  
5. user enters an attempted guess
  - add guess to userGuesses[] array
  - guess displays on screen
  - update local storage with current guess
    - stringify
    - set item
  - match user guess to answer
    - use function
  - display symbols for correct or close matches (positions and correct colors/letters)
    - event handler

6. user runs out of guesses or answers correctly
  - disable event listener
  - update user stats
    - stringify and set to local storage
  - display correct answer
  - render and display user stats
  - play again button to play again:
    - clear current game board and render a new one for this user
    - reset game state in local storage

 take array of words and get a random word from an index
