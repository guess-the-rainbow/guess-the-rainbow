Rhea Carillo, Alfredo Orquiz, and Brooke Heck

## Cooperation Plan

**What are the key strengths of each person on the team?**

Rhea: One of my key strengths is thinking outside the box. I like have to have a box to think outside of. One of my other strengths is a finding discrepancies and debugging.

Alfredo: One of my key strengths is that I am really adaptable to my environments, and I can really work with anyone. I am also good at CSS, not the best, but decent. I am good at creativity and imagination, and can out that on the website.

Brooke: My key strength is using data structures in JavaScript. I have coded before in Java which is very heavy in OOP and is strictly typed so using data structures is a little trickier. Translating these skills to JavaScript has been a little easier for me because JavaScript is not strictly typed and its nice to put anything into an array and using objects is also a familiar concept.

**How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?**

Our strengths will work well together because they are all different and complimentary. Rhea will be good at planning and figuring out different ways to solve the requirements of the project. Brooke will can help with the actual execution of the application function. Alfredo can give the application a good design with his strength of CSS styling.

**In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?**

Rhea: I would like to develop my Confidence professional competency, primarily. I also would like to grow my Dependability and Reliability muscles.

Alfredo: Analytical thinking, Problem solving, Incremental delivery, Planning and estimating, Root cause resolution, Tool proficiency, Technical and Credibility.

Brooke: A professional competency I want to improve on is creativity. I'm pretty good about reading instructions and hitting requirements, but when it comes to creating new projects and features on my own, I struggle. This project is super open ended and allows us to build whatever we want so there is a lot of opportunity to grow in this competency during this project.

**Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?**

Before we start coding or when we hit major points of the project, we will talk about what we accomplished and where we will go from there. This will help avoid anybody from coding for hours without collaborating with the group and will also allow us to take breaks from coding. At then end of the day we will also regroup and go over what is happening and any issues that need to be resolved. The end of the day check in is a good time to sync all of our code and resolve with GitHub.

At the beginning of each day we can do a code review similar to how we start classes. This will help us better better plan out what got done and what needs to be done.

There is a lot of pre-work for this project with creating diagrams and checklist. Following, changing, and updating all of these will help us stay on course and know what needs to be done.

## Conflict Plan
**What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?**

If we don't agree we need to talk about what the conflict is and understand each others perspectives. Once we understand each other, we will come to a compromise before progress with the project. Before we start the project, establishing boundaries and expectations will make it clear how to treat group members while resolving conflicts.

**What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?**

If one person starts to take over the project, it is the responsibility of others in the group to bring this to the attention of the person taking over. In our cooperation plan, we had decided to have multiple check-ins and this is a good time to divide work evenly. We just need to make sure that we stick the parts of the plans that were assigned and if deviation is required, we need to communicate to the group.

**How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?**

Again, this will rely heavily on communication between group members. If somebody doesn't understand what is going on they need to ask, and others in the group need to be respectful of others learning. During the planned code reviews we will make sure everyone understands the purpose and logic of the code being implemented.

**How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?**

There is probably a reason that someone is not contributing their assigned parts. They may not understand or have personal reasons for falling behind. We need to come together and understand why they aren't meeting expectations and how we can help them meet those expectations.

**How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?**

If we have tried to understand and help the person meet expectations and they are still unable or unwilling to contribute or improve then we will escalate the conflict.

## Communication Plan
**What hours will you be available to communicate?**

Obviously during class we will be collaborating and communicating, but outside of class we need to be respectful of others time. The following is guidelines for communicating with each person in the group.

Rhea: I will be open to messaging on Slack each work day from 7 a.m to 6 p.m. I will also be available most hours on Saturday and until 9 p.m. on Sundays.

Alfredo: During class I wil be available. After school hours I am available to reach normally until 11:00 p.m. or midnight. I am available on the weekends on the mornings, but in the evening or at night I am working on lyft. If you are trying to reach me, I will respond and try to reach out ASAP.

Brooke: After class I really don't care if anybody messages me, but I can't guarantee a response. I will for sure check my phone before I go to bed and answer messages, but after I go to bed there is basically no chance of me answering. I'm available most weekends but try to get as much done during the week so that I can enjoy my weekends.

**What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?**

We will use Slack, but we will be in class everyday so we will try to get as much done in person as possible.

**How often will you take breaks?**

Every hour or fifty minutes we will take a 10 minute break. Rhea has a visual timer that she will bring so that we remember to take breaks and so that we start working when breaks are over.

**What is your plan if you start to fall behind?**

If we start falling behind we can use the TAs to help us get to our MVP. We can also come together and prioritize the most important tasks that will get us to our MVP. If we still aren't meeting our project timeline we can talk to the instructor.

**How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?**

We can communicate over Slack, but remember to be respectful of the times that others have been asked to be contacted.

**What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?**

During code reviews and check ins we already decided to talk about how the project is going and making sure everyone is on the same page. This is a good time to bring up new ideas or problems that people are having. We can also add comments and reflections in the README.md file that will document how we are cooperating.

**How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?**

We will practice active listening and verbally acknowledge what others have to say. Reiterating and summarizing is a good way to show that you are understand what others are saying. Avoid placing blame when conflicts arise and focus on solutions. We will solicit feedback from our group members and acknowledge their contributions.

## Work Plan
**How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?**

We will use tools like Trello and other tools like to keep track of tasks that need to be done, are in progress, and complete. Tasks will be assigned by group consensus during code reviews everyday.

**What project management tool will be used?**

Trello, GitHub, Slack, and a diagram tool for the UML will all be used to help us create and track project progress.

## GitHub
**What components of your project will live on GitHub?**

Our main branch along with the development and individual feature branches will be on GitHub. We can also create a directory with all the prep work and planning so all members have access. GitHub also has a project planner that we can use to plan and track what parts of the project need to be worked on and what has been completed.

**How will you share the repository with your teammates?**

One person will create an organization and then add the group members to the organization. This is where the repository will be created.

**What is your Git flow?**

So our repository will have a development branch that the majority of pull requests will be made to. Each time we work on a feature the person working on that feature will create a new branch. When they are done working on that feature, they will make a pull request to the development branch. Only when all features are working and all group members agree, we will do a pull request to our main branch.

**Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:**
- How many people must review a PR?
\
Since we are a small group, both other group members will need to approve a pull request before it is merged. This will help all group members understand what is happening in the new code that is added.

- Who merges PRs?
\
The last person approving the pull request can merge the branches.

- How often will you merge?
\
Merging to the development branch will happen anytime someone makes a new working feature and both other people approve that pull request. The main branch can only be merged with the development branch at the end of the day if the code is functioning and all group members agree. This can also happen at the beginning of the day if members made changes after class.

- How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?
\
We will be in class together and alert others when we make a pull request. The merge will happen after all approvals have been made. At the end of the day will agree on merging the dev and main branches.
